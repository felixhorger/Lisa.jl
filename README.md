# Lisa.jl - Call BART from Julia

Thanks to the developers of the Berkeley Advanced (MRI) Reconstruction Toolbox [BART](https://github.com/mrirecon/bart)!

### Functionality:

- Read/write cfl files used by BART.
- Trying to make BART work directly on julia arrays without writing to files, this requires my [fork](https://github.com/felixhorger/bart) of BART.
